# Fraud-Detection

## Introduction
Banks are often exposed to fraud transactions and constantly improve systems to track them.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to perform Data Analysis on 'Fraud Detection' dataset and compute the probability of attrition using various algorithms. I tried many algorithms and got the best accuracy in Decision Tree Classifier which is 100% accurate.

## About the dataset:
Bank dataset that contains 20k+ transactions with 112 features (numerical).

## Dataset details:
Columns: From column_0 to column_111 contains numbers and decimals.
Target: Contains binary data (0's and 1's).
